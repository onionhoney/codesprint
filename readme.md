## CodeSprint Judge System (Adapted from UCPCCC)

Changes I made last year: 
Supported switching between sessions. 
Supported giving problems different weight. 


Todos this year:

Link this site to our homepage more smoothly. 

Make the login system more natural.
(instead of us generating everything for them, maybe create a frontend for them to give us their pass when they are registering? )

Support Python maybe? (would be hard)

Make scoring easier? (combine individual and team score and display them)
