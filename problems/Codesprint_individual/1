## Problem G - Tnge Twstr

Jeremy loves partying but often attracts too much attention to himself when he's drunk, much to the annoyance of his girlfriend. Fortunately, whenever Jeremy loses a game at a party he gets embarrassed and quickly leaves the party. Mandy wants to stop Jeremy's partying addiction by making Jeremy lose party games.

One day, in his drunken state at a Thursday night party, Jeremy gathers all the girls around to show off his verbal prowess with a game of TngeTwstr. The game goes as follows.

First Jeremy selects a string $s$. Given any integer $k$ $(0 < k < |s|)$, he considers the set $b_k$: the set of all subsequences of $s$ with length $k$ without consecutive adjacent characters. If the $b_k$ is nonempty, he randomly selects one subsequence from $b_k$ and rapidly recites it $20$ times. If Jeremy stutters, he loses the game!

Mandy knows Jeremy stutters when pronouncing a word if and only if the word ends in a vowel. Help Mandy make Jeremy lose the game by determining Jeremy's probability of losing for each length $k$.

For this problem, vowels are characters belonging to the set {$'a','e','i','o','u'$}. String s will only consist of lowercase letters

### Input

The first line of the input is an integer $t$ $(0 \leq t \leq 50)$ indicating the number of test cases. 

The first and only line of each test case consists of a string $s$ $(0 \leq |s| \leq 2000)$. String $s$ will only consist of lower case letters.

### Output

For each test case, output three integers $|s|-1$ lines. On the ith line, output $r % MOD$ and $p % MOD$, where $MOD=1000000007$.

$r$ denotes the size of $b_i$,

$p$ denotes the number of elements from $b_i$ that will make Jeremy stutter. 


### Sample Input
```
2
bba
cda
```

### Sample Output
```
2 1
1 1
3 1
3 2
```

Explanation of sample test cases:

For the first test case, consider all possible values of $k$.

When $k = 1$, $b_k$ is {"b","a"}, $r = 2$, $p = 1$.

When $k = 2$, $b_k$ is {"ba"}. ("bb" has consecutive adjacent characters), $r = 1$, $p = 1$.



For the second test case, consider all possible values of k.

When k = 1, $b_k$ is {"c","d","a"}, r = 3, p = 1

When k = 2, $b_k$ is {"cd","ca","da"}, r = 3, p = 2
