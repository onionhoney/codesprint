# Überwatch (GCPC 2017)

The game is observed over $n$ time slices. The ultimate attack is initially not charged and requires
$m$ time slices to charge. This first possible use of the ultimate attack is therefore in the ($m$+1)-th
time slice. If the ultimate attack is used in the $i$-th time slice, it immediately begins charging
again and is ready to be fired in the ($i + m$)-th time slice.

### Input
The input consists of:
• one line with two integers n and m, where
– $n$ ($1 ≤ n ≤ 300 000$) is the game duration;
– $m$ ($1 ≤ m ≤ 10$) is the time needed to charge the ultimate attack in time slices.
• one line with $n$ integers $x_i$ ($0 ≤ x_i ≤ 32$) describing the number of opponents in view
during a time slice in order.

### Output
Output the maximum number of opponents you can defeat.
