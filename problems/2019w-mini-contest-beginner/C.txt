# An Integer's Parent

An integer $n$ has a kid which follows this rule: 

- If $n$ is nonpositive: $kid(n) = 1$
- Else if $n$ is odd: $kid(n) = kid(n-1) + kid(n-3)$
- Else if $n$ is even: $kid(n) = kid(n/2) + kid(n-2) + kid(n-4)$

Given a kid $m$ where $10^{19} > m > 1$ (hint: use long long instead of int), find its smallest parent. If the kid has no parents, then return -1.

### Input

The input will be in the form of a number $t$ denoting the number of test cases, followed by $t$ lines each with a single integer $m$.

### Output

Output the solution as $t$ lines, with one solution on each line.
