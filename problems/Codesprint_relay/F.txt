## Relay 2C. The Splendid Collatz

Given an arbitrary positive integer $ n \in \mathbb{N^+} $, we perform the following operation :


$$
f(n) =  \begin{cases} n / 2, &\text{n is even}  \\\\ 3n + 1, &\text{n is odd} \end{cases}
$$

The Collatz conjecture is that after repeating this process long enough, we will eventually reach the number 1, regardless of what n we begin with. However, it is known that some numbers are especially tricky, taking a great many steps before reaching 1. Your task is find the smallest number $m$ such that the number of steps it takes to reach 1 equals $k$, for some $ k \gt 0$. For example, when k = 1, m = 2. 

### Input

Let's use W to denote the number you get from the last problem. Then $ k = (W \mod 97) + 10 â€‹$.

### Output

Simply output m. It is guaranteed that m exists and is small enough to be computed during the contest. In fact, you may reference the following statistics quoted from Wikipedia:

>
> less than 1,000 is 871, which has 178 steps,
>
> less than 10,000 is 6,171, which has 261 steps,

Sample input: 
k = 13
Sample output: 
34
