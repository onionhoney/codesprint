## Relay 1C

Janey is a linguistic major and learns many alphabet systems in her spare time. She has a peculiar way of measuring her fondness of an alphabet: the number of possible distinct strings of length $10$ that do not have consecutive characters.

The input will only contain one number $n$ $(0 \leq n \leq 10000)$ denoting the number of characters in the ith alphabet system. Since Janeyâ€™s fondness of a language can be very large, output the fondness mod $1000000007$.
