## Relay 2B. The Sleeping Beauty

Once upon a time, there was a princess named Sarah who loved to sleep. In fact, she would stay on the bed all day, wallowing around even when she's wide awake. One day a terrific idea struck her â€” to fill her very large bedroom with all the beds she can find! 

It is known that her bedroom is a long rectangle with width 3 and depth $k (k \ge 3)$, with a door opening on one narrow side, and a window on the other. The beds in her kingdom come in two shapes, 1\*3 and 2\*3, each with infinitely many supplies. However, princess Sarah doesn't want to get bored, so she decides to use a different bed layout each day. Two layouts are considered the same if they are indistinguishable from another when observed from the window to the door. 

Help her calculate the number of ways to completely fill her bedroom. Notice that you **don't** necessarily have to use all types of bed. 

### Input

Let's use W to denote the number you get from the last problem. Then $ k = (W \mod 10) + 10 $.

### Output

The number of ways to completely fill Sarah's bedroom by the requirements, modulo 10007.

It is guaranteed that the answers are within 10^9. Therefore there's no need to worry about overflow while you calculate.

Sample input 1: 
k = 3 (the actual input would be at least 10 though)
Sample output 1:
6
Explanation for sample 1: 
|x|x|x| |x|x|x| |x|x|y| |x|y|y| |x|x|x| |x|y|z|
|y|y|y| |x|x|x| |x|x|y| |x|y|y| |y|y|y| |x|y|z|
|y|y|y| |y|y|y| |x|x|y| |x|y|y| |z|z|z| |x|y|z| 
Here are all the six possible layouts. Each letter denotes a bed.

Sample input 2:
k = 5
Sample output 2:
