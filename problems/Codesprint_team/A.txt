## Problem A - Adventure Time!

Nope, you aren't going to be watching TV today. Today, you'll be trying to form a party with some random people to fight the boss monster in the MMORPG Hack 'n Slash VI!

Last time you went on a quest in this game, your party members were absolutly horrendous. They kept taking your kills and refusing to heal you! This time, however, you know better than to just pick party members randomly. You came up with a way to determine if a party member will be good or not based on their username.

You know that if a player has an even number of distinct letters in his or her username, then they will be a good fit with your party. Uppercase letters will be considered the same as lowercase letters, and numbers are ignored. To speed things up though, you decide to write a program to help you quickly determine if a user is acceptable.

### Input

The first line of the input consist of a single integer $t$ $(1 \leq t \leq 100)$, the number of test cases. 

Each test case will consist of a single line with one string with length no more than $100$ characters, the username of someone who wants to join your party.

### Output

Output one line for each test case, with the text "INVITE TO PARTY" if you should take the user into your party, or "TRASH TALK THE USER" if not*.

\* We do not condone this sort of behavior when playing online games.
