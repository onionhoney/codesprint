# UCLA Tunneling

UCLA has a rich set of traditions from its cross-town rivalry to its display of talent during spring sing to its tantalizing potential for adventure in the underground tunnels.

You have an UCLA bucketlist to experience all of them. You have decided to try tunneling first, since the tunnels have piqued your interest ever since orientation. However, UCLA has gotten increasingly tight on security, so you elicited help from your friend Mark (an UCLA alumni and experienced tunneler).

Mark tells you that there is an entrance to the northern tunnels under Royce Hall. He also tells that you that there will be a combination lock that you will need to unlock to get in.

A combination lock can be unlocked by knowing 3 numbers, each number is between 0 and 99. For example, to unlock a combination lock, whose password is 7 34 17, rotate the dial clockwise until it reaches 7, then counterclockwise until it reaches 34, and then rotate the dial clockwise again stopping on 17.

Mark directs you to an advance combination lock cracking equipment that will allow you to listen to the inner mechanism of the lock and determine if the number that dial is currently on is below, at, or above the number that unlocks it. We will use 0, 1, and 2 to represent if your current guess is below, at, or above the actual number respectively.

Your goal is to unlock the $n$ locks that UCLA uses to prevent people from entering the tunnels as quickly as possible by obtaining the password (3 numbers) for each lock.

### Input

The first line contains $n(1 \leq n \leq 1000)$ -- number of locks (test cases)

For each lock:

The lines 1-3 contains numbers $a\_1, a\_2, ..., a\_{100}(0 \leq a_i \leq 2)$ -- numbers your device outputs to you for trying each number on dial 

### Output

For each lock, output the 3 numbers that unlocks that lock (space seperated)
