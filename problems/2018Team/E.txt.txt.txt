Simple Banach-Mazur
Two people, Alice and Bob, are playing a game on an array of size $2^n$. Every element in the array is either an A or a B. On the first turn, Alice chooses a contiguous subarray of exactly half the size of the original array. On the second turn, Bob chooses a contiguous subarray of exactly half the size of the new array. Play alternates in this fashion until only one element remains. If it is an A, Alice wins, and if it is a B, Bob wins. Assuming both players play optimally, who wins?

Input
The first line of the input consists of a single integer $t$ ($1 \leq t \leq 500$), the number of test cases.

Each test case will have 2 lines:
The first line of each test case will be a single integer, $n$ ($0 \leq n \leq 17$), the size of the array.

The second line will contain $2^n$ space separated characters (either 'A' or 'B') denoting who would win if the game ended on that element.

Output
Output a single character (followed by a new line) for each test case, representing the player who, if they play optimally, is guaranteed to win.
