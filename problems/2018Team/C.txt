# Problem 1C - Volatile Boom Bots

After a couple of the years in the wild, Dr. Boom has advanced his technology. He is now able to mass-produce his Boom Bots, and has all of them set up on an assembly line that produces one Boom Bot per second. However, due to the perils of mass production, all the fuses on the Boom Bots are faulty. As of a result, before they go off the assembly line and get ready for shipping, they have a *p<sub>i</sub>* chance to blow up itself and the next *b<sub>i</sub>* Boom Bots after it.

Given *n* faulty Boom Bots on the line, what is the expected number of Boom Bots that will have been produced at *s* seconds?

#### Input
The first line contains one integer *c* (1 ≤ c ≤ 15) - the number of test cases.

The second line contains two integers *n* and *s* (1 ≤ *n, s* ≤ 1000) - the number of Boom Bots on the assembly line, and the queried number of seconds.

The third line contains *n* doubles *p<sub>1</sub>, p<sub>2</sub>*, ..., *p<sub>n</sub>* (0 ≤ *p<sub>i</sub>* ≤ 1) - the chance that the i<sup>th</sup> Boom Bot will explode.

The fourth line contains *n* integers *b<sub>1</sub>, b<sub>2</sub>*, ..., *b<sub>n</sub>* (0 ≤ *b<sub>i</sub>* ≤ 5) - the amount of Boom Bots that come after it that will be destroyed if the i<sup>th</sup> Boom Bot explodes.

#### Output
Print *c* integers (newline-seperated) - the expected number (rounded down) of Boom Bots that have been produced (have gone off the assembly line) at time *s* for each test case.

#### Example Explanations
In the first example, both Boom Bots have a 0% chance to explode. At the first second, the first Boom Bot will be produced, and at the second second, the second Boom Bot will be produced. However, because there are only 2 Boom Bots on the assembly line, the larger amount of time makes no difference, and the final expected number of Boom Bots is 2.

In the second example, at the first second, the first Boom Bot has a 100% chance to explode, destroying the second and third Boom Bots on the assembly line. At the second second, because the second Boom Bot was already destroyed, the final expected number of Boom Bots is 0.

The third example is similar to that of the second example, but the queried number of seconds is 4. Becacuse the first Boom Bot only destroyed Bot 2 and 3, the 4<sup>th</sup> is left untouched. As such, by the fourth second, we will have produced Boom Bot 4, and will as such have 1 total Boom Bot.

In the fourth example, by the end of the second second there is a 25% that there are no Boom Bots, 25% chance for the first Boom Bot to survive, 25% chance for the second Boom Bot to survive, and a 25% chance for both Bots to survive. As such, there is a 25% chance for 0 to survive, 50% chance for 1 to survive, and 25% chance for 2 to survive. As such, the expected value is  0.25 × 0 + 0.50 × 1 + 0.25 × 2 = 1.
