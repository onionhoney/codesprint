## Catanner

Andy is trapped in his own nightmare! In order to escape the dream and wake up, he must challenge a wise old wizard to a game of Catan. With his future on the line, Andy can't decide where to place his settlements. He wants to maximize the value of his own settlements but also minimize the value of his opponent's settlements. Given a Catan board, assuming Andy plays first and that both players play optimally, what will be the difference between Andy and the Wizard's settlement values?

Each Catan board is pyramid of hexagons. The first row has one hexagon, the second row has two hexagons right below the first row, and so on. Each hexagon has a number from 2 to 12, not including 7. Hexagons with numbers 2 or 12 are worth 1; 3 or 11 are worth 2; 4 or 10 are worth 3; 5 or 9 are worth 4; 6 or 8 will be worth 5.

Each player may place their settlement at the vertice of any hexagon. The settlement is worth the summation of value of the hexagons adjacent to his settlement. For example, if Andy places his settlement at the intersection of three hexagons with numbers 12, 4, and 3, the settlement value is 1 + 3 + 2 = 6.

Andy will start by placing his settlement first. After Andy, the wizard will place two settlements. Then, Andy will place his final settlement to end the settlement placing. No settlement may share a hexagon edge with a previous, already placed settlement.

Given a Catan board and assuming both players play optimally to maximize the difference between their own settlement value and their opponent's settlement value, return the difference between Andy and the Wizard's settlement values.

### Input
The first line of the input consist of a single integer t denoting the number of test cases where 1 <= t <= 100.

The start of each test case is a single integer n denoting the number of rows of the Catan board for that test case where 2 <= n <= 200.

The next n lines of that test case consist of the n rows of the Catan board. Each row is in the form the form of space separated numbers which indicate the hexagon numbers.

### Output
For each test case, output a single line with a single integer x.

x is the the difference between your two settlements’ value and your opponents’ two settlement value, if you play optimally to maximize this difference.

#### Explanation
##### Test Case 1

![Example1](https://tinyurl.com/first-tiny-pic)

- 1: Andy picks House 1. House 1 is adjacent to hexagons numbers 10, 8 and 6. This translate to a settlement valued 3 + 5 + 5 = 13 pts
- 2: The Wizard picks House 2. House 2 is adjacent to hexagons numbers 6 and 9 for a value of 5 + 4 = 9 pts
- 3: The Wizard picks House 3 which is adjacent to hexagon numbers 8 and 9 for a value of 5 + 4 = 9 pts
- 4: Andy picks House 4 with hexagon numbers 4 and 8. This totals a value of 4 + 4 = 8 pts

The difference between Andy's and the Wizard's settlement values is 13 - 9 - 9 + 8 = 3 pts Thus the solution is 3.

##### Test Case 2

![Example2](https://tinyurl.com/second-tiny-pic)
- 1: Andy picks House 1 for 12 pts.
- 2: The Wizard picks House 2 for 11 pts.
- 3: The Wizard picks House 3 for 9 pts.
- 4: Andy picks House 4 for 8 pts.

The difference between Andy's and the Wizard's settlement values is 12 - 11 - 9 + 8 = 0 pts. Thus the solution is 0.
